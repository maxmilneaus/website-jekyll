VOICE was a public art project co-designed by Adam Hunt and myself as [Transmit Receive](http://transmitreceive.tumblr.com/) in 2012. We took a therapeutic approach to capturing peoples personal stories and turned them into a series of performance art projects in Edinburgh, UK and Melbourne, AUS. Along with a special edition developed for ABC Radio National podcast Long Story Short. Here is a little story of how it all came together. 

I worked on [[move your body every day]] and also [[accents]] for this deep project.
