I founded Studio Brunswick out of an Artist Studio I was part of and built it into three individual 100 square meter loft-style photography studios.

Working via a strategic partnership with [Nightgale Housing](https://www.nightingalehousing.org) for Studio Two and Three. Transforming buildings earmarked for development into vibrant creative spaces for the final three years of their lives in Brunswick Industrial Area.

At our peak we were a team of five, orchestrating in-house staff and administrative duties, culminating in over 800 successful studio hires.

Plenty of interesting clients with brands such as Kodak, Foxtel, Google, Milk Records, Universal Music Group, MECCA and Discount Universe.

During this time I wanted to help support Photography Assistant's in ways I felt I would of loved to be supported when I was training. Thus we established the Photography Assistant School alongside the 'Assistant in Residence' program. Where we provided ten emerging photographers with two-month residencies that included free weekly studio use.

Being based in a creative zone we organised and co-curated annual Multidisciplinary Community Art Show fundraisers from 2015 to 2018, focusing on climate change themes. Successfully raised over $20,000 for environmental and humanitarian organisations, including Friends of the Earth and The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.
