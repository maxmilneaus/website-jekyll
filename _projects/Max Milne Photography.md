A photographic company I founded in 2008 that started by taking photos for a Youth Council Project, ramped up toward advertising work for [Sydney Festival](https://www.sydneyfestival.org.au), Bendigo Bank and Melbourne University and returned to earth with COVID.

I had the luck of picking up a couple of awards along the way and working with so many different teams around Australia. Co-winner Faces of Sydney Festival Competition (2017) and Head On Portrait Prize (2012). Winner of the BSG National Photographic Prize (2011).


**Collaborative Projects and Client Management:** Led and collaborated creative teams of up to fifteen people including Art Directors, Stylists, Models, Hair and Makeup Artists, Assistants and Clients, maintaining strong partnerships with agencies such as PLOT, BBDO, and Clemenger. Managed national and international clients, including Telstra, RACV, Qantas, Bendigo Bank, TAC, The Florey Institute, Melbourne University, and major brands through Blend/Getty Image Agency.
